# Sprinty⚡⚡



Sprinty is a task management application designed to streamline your workflow. With drag-and-drop (DnD) capabilities, Sprinty offers an intuitive way to organize boards, lists, cards, and task details for efficient project management.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is not just to build another task management app — there are plenty of those already. Instead, Sprinty focuses on utilizing available tools and frameworks to build a robust and solid project using best practices. This includes:



- Leveraging GitHub functionalities such as GitHub Actions, Issues, and Projects [![Projects](https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/evericons-16px/16/external-link-16.png)](https://github.com/users/Zindiks/projects/6)
- Demonstrating how to structure and maintain a modern codebase.
- Avoiding the use of external tools like Jira by fully utilizing GitHub Projects for task and issue tracking.
- Plans to implement CI/CD practices to ensure smooth and reliable deployments.
- Deploying the application to AWS for scalability and real-world hosting experience.
